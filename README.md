## Testing

### Unit Testing
- **Tools Used**: Mocha, Sinon, Chai, Supertest  
  Unit tests cover individual functions and components to ensure they behave as expected in isolation.  

### Mutation Testing
- **Tools Used**: Stryker  
  Mutation testing validates the robustness of your test suite by introducing mutations and checking if tests detect them.

### Load Testing
- **Tools Used**: Apache JMeter  
  Simulates a high number of concurrent users to assess the system's performance and scalability under stress.

### Black Box Testing
- Focuses on testing system functionality without internal knowledge of code implementation. Ensures that inputs produce expected outputs.

### GUI Testing
- **Tools Used**: Selenium or Cypress  
  Automates interactions with the graphical user interface to ensure all UI components function correctly and provide a good user experience.
